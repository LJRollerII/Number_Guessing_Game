# Number Guessing Game

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project, I created a game using the random module in python, where the user tries to guess the number generated by python. The code is designed to let the user know if they've guessed too high or low on incorrect submissions. Once the user guesses the correct number, they will know how many attempts it took them guess correctly.

**<u>Inspiration</u>**

This project was inspired by the programmer Tim Ruscica, also known as Tech With Tim.
